# DAG-BFT

A Go implementation of **FaBFT (Flexible Asynchronous BFT Protocol using DAG)** ‚Äì a novel consensus algorithm designed to work efficiently in both partially synchronous and fully asynchronous networks, leveraging the BlockDAG structure to improve throughput and concurrency.

## Features

- **Flexible Consensus**: Supports both optimistic and pessimistic network assumptions, enabling clients to choose ledgers accordingly.
- **BlockDAG-based**: Organizes blocks in a DAG rather than a linear chain, improving parallelism and utilization of bandwidth.
- **Asynchronous BFT**: Removes dependency on time bounds or view change, ensuring robustness under network fluctuations.
- **Efficient CBC and GPC**: Uses Consistent Broadcast (CBC) and Global Perfect Coin (GPC) for lower latency and better randomness.

## Prerequisites

- Go 1.19 or higher
- Git
